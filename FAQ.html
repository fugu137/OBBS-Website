                    <h3>1. What is the difference between bookkeeping & accounting?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bookkeeping is about the day-in-day-out financial record keeping and reporting and

                        is
                        using
                        the financial information to make important financial decisions about a business entity.

                        This will depend on your or your businesses needs. If you are a sole trader, you may only

                        prepare financial reports and statement on a daily, weekly, monthly or periodic basis.
